SPlisHSPlasH is an open-source library for the physically-based simulation of fluids. The simulation in this library is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method which is a popular meshless Lagrangian approach to simulate complex fluid effects. The SPH formalism allows an efficient computation of a certain quantity of a fluid particle by considering only a finite set of neighboring particles. One of the most important research topics in the field of SPH methods is the simulation of incompressible fluids. SPlisHSPlasH implements current state-of-the-art pressure solvers (WCSPH, PCISPH, PBF, IISPH, DFSPH) to simulate incompressibility. Moreover, the library provides different methods to simulate viscosity and surface tension. 

The library uses the following external libraries: [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/), [partio](https://github.com/wdas/partio/), [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib), [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [AntTweakBar](http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/) (only for the demos). All external dependencies are included. 

Furthermore we use our own libraries:
- [PositionBasedDynamics](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/PositionBasedDynamics/) to simulate dynamic rigid bodies
- [CompactNSearch](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/CompactNSearch) to perform the neighborhood search
